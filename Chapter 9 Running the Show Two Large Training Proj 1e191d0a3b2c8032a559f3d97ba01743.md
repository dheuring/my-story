# Chapter 9:  Running the Show: Two Large Training Projects (1997-2009)

Leading the Military Language Institute project for AMIDEAST was the most ambitious chapter of my career. I collaborated closely with UAE Armed Forces personnel to build a state-of-the-art language institute from the ground up, skillfully navigating cultural nuances and diplomatic complexities. Over six years, I grew the program from an initial five teachers to more than 130 across five locations, overseeing this multi-million-dollar instructional initiative while developing innovative curricula and integrating networked technology. Leadership came with its share of challenges—including cross-cultural tensions, legal hurdles, major personnel crises, and HR situations that often blurred the line between the professional and the personal.

Initially, family life maintained balance. Miam and I settled into our spacious villa, the boys attended a nearby international school, and we reconnected with friends from Egypt providing a regular social outlet. However, as work demands intensified, family dynamics shifted. Joey graduated and left for college, while I belatedly addressed Danny's academic struggles by sending him to boarding school in Ohio—a solution that helped academically but separated us during his remaining high school years. Meanwhile, my marriage quietly evolved into parallel lives under one roof—maintaining appearances while living with unacknowledged distance.

Near the end of my second three-year contract, politics abruptly terminated the AMIDEAST agreement—a disappointing conclusion to six years of dedicated work. This apparent setback led to an unexpected opportunity when the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company offered me leadership of a major curriculum modernization initiative. I assembled a high-performing team, navigated complex organizational dynamics, and integrated technology into customized curriculum over the next six years. During this latter period, I also began a new personal relationship with Alisa that would gradually transform my life.

After twelve years in the UAE, I emerged professionally accomplished and personally changed. This chapter taught me profound lessons about determination, innovation, and reinvention—that endings often seed new beginnings, and that challenges can deliver unexpected gifts. The expertise I gained prepared me for a new type of leadership at AMIDEAST headquarters, while my relationship with Alisa continued along a path that would redefine my understanding of partnership. What began as a career opportunity in the UAE became the bridge to a meaningful new chapter in both my professional and personal life.
