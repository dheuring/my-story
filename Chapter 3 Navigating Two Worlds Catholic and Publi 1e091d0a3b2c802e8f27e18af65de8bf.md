# Chapter 3:  Navigating Two Worlds: Catholic and Public School Life (1966-1970)

My adolescent years marked a transition from the sheltered world of Catholic school to the unpredictable environment of public high school. During my first two years at St. Michael Catholic High School, I thrived within the structured routines rooted in faith and tradition. Still devout, I studied Latin with hopes of one day entering the priesthood, even as I witnessed the Church being reshaped by the reforms of Vatican II. As my religious world shifted, so did my daily life. I began embracing typical high school experiences—sports, cafeteria lunches, rotating classrooms, and a growing sense of independence. Academically, I performed adequately, with a stronger inclination toward history than math, while increasingly gravitating toward athletics, which offered both connection with my peers and common ground with my sports-enthusiast father.

Then came the pivotal moment: the Catholic high school closed. My classmates and I transferred to the new public school, STMA, and the transition proved challenging. The familiar structure vanished, replaced by freedoms I wasn't prepared to handle. My performance declined, I faced disciplinary issues, and lost some direction. The new environment triggered more reactive than positive changes. At home, our growing family enjoyed improved financial stability, even as space tightened with each new sibling. The contrast between home stability and school disruption created an interesting tension in my development.

Nevertheless, public school brought valuable new relationships and lessons. Being demoted to the basketball B team humbled me but prompted reassessment. I learned that talent alone wasn't sufficient—dedication and attitude mattered more. By senior year, I had regained my footing. I excelled athletically, participated in drama, and joined the popular social circle—while also engaging in the typical senior-year social drinking and occasional mischief.

This transition represents more than just changing schools—it reveals how two contrasting environments shaped my developing identity. One offered structure and tradition; the other presented freedom and unfamiliar challenges. This latter period forced me to stumble, rebel, adapt, and grow—a formative time when I began discovering my authentic self, unaware of the many transformations still ahead. The lessons learned during this time would serve as a foundation for navigating future changes and challenges throughout my life.
