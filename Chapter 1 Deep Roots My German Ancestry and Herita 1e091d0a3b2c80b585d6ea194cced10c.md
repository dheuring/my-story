# Chapter 1:  Deep Roots: My German Ancestry and Heritage

In the opening chapter of my story, I explore the roots that shaped my identity. Growing up, I was always aware of my German ancestry. My parents came from German-American families who had spoken the language at home until World War II prompted them to stop to avoid suspicion. Yet our heritage persisted through family stories, surnames, and the older generation's occasional switch to German when they wanted privacy from young ears. Years later, DNA tests confirmed my predominantly European roots while revealing a surprising 1.7% Bedouin ancestry—an intriguing connection given my decades working with Arab communities.

I once viewed my heritage simply as half Heuring and half Becker, but ancestry research uncovered a more complex legacy of sixteen distinct family lines, each contributing equally to who I am. This discovery highlighted the often-overlooked importance of one’s maternal lineage. Heuring (herdsman) and Becker (baker) weren't just names but reflections of ancestral trades, with agriculture forming a common thread on both sides. My great-great-grandfather Andreas Heuring left Bavaria, Germany in 1867, settling in Otsego Township to establish his farm. Though his original house is gone, the one built by his son, my great-grandfather George David, still stands amid modern developments. Similarly, my great-grandfather Pius Becker immigrated from Baden in 1887, also drawn by Homestead Act promises, eventually owning two farms in Hassan Township near the Crow River dam.

Though I grew up in town, my childhood was enriched by time on my uncles' farms—baling hay, riding a Shetland pony, and playing hide-and-seek among the sheds. These experiences fostered values of hard work, family bonds, and connection to the land deeply rooted in generations of agricultural life. St. Michael wasn't just my hometown but a pocket of faith, German tradition, and shared values, with the church, convent, and Catholic school at its center.

This heritage formed my foundation, remaining steady as I journeyed beyond Minnesota. Decades abroad, immersed in diverse cultures, never diminished my connection to that small-town grounding. The values shaped by rural life—family farms, close-knit community, and enduring German traditions—remained my anchor. No matter how far I traveled or how many years passed, my roots in German heritage and rural Minnesota remained an unshakable part of my identity.
